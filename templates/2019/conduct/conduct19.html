        <p>If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the conference, or are concerned that another attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of conference staff or contact our code of conduct liaison volunteers. See <a href="/2019/coc/eporting-guidelines/" class>how to report a code of conduct concern</a>.</p>

<p>Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with according to <a href="/2019/coc/guidelines" class>a documented procedure for handling code of conduct reports</a>.</p>

<p>Conference staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the conference. Any concern, whatever it is, will be immediately passed on to a member of the conference committee. The committee will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action. This could include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>asking a violator of the Code of Conduct to leave the event immediately (no refunds will be forthcoming)</li>
	<li>passing on details of the incident to the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" class>Python Software Foundation</a></li>
	<li>informing the police about the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide you with a written statement of the outcome, whatever it is.</p>

<h3>Transparency report</h3>
